# ðŸ§¬ Gene Sequence Annotation Pipeline

A Python-based pipeline for comprehensive gene sequence annotation using GENCODE data, machine learning models (CNNs/RNNs), and interactive visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Gene annotation is the process of identifying and labeling elements of the genome, such as protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, and non-coding RNAs. This project builds a robust pipeline to:
- Parse and process **GENCODE GFF3** annotation files
- Annotate genes using rules and **deep learning models**
- Visualize genomic features
- Provide tools for further bioinformatics and ML research
